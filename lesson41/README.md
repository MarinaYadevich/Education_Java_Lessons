### It is necessary to create a spring boot project by connecting the following starters:

1) web

2) actuator

Create a regular controller. In the controller, use the @Value annotation to inject any of your own properties.

Test that the request gets to the controller, display it in the property logs.

Unlock all actuator endpoints. Check that the actuator displays all spring beans.
